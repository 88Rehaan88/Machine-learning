# Brain Stroke Prediction

üìå  **Project Overview**

This project aims to predict the likelihood of a person suffering from a stroke based on various health and demographic factors. The dataset used contains information such as age, gender, hypertension, heart disease, BMI, smoking habits, and more. The goal is to build a machine learning model that can accurately classify individuals as stroke or non-stroke cases.
